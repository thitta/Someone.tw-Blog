 People of different background learn Python. When we become more and more familiar with the most understandable part of it; some specific syntax could appear confusing and become a long-lasting unresolved problem in our mind.

That's the reason why I wrote this series: **Intermediate Python with Lucid Show Case**. As a self-taught programmer, I prefer to end a period of study with a self-devised example and note them done. In my experience, output, or we say, writing, is always an indispensable part when acquiring knowledge -- include but not limited to coding. During this process, learners can effectively internalize the content they just acquire and build an reliable path for future recalling -- once we know how to recall the knowledge, we can claim that we actually HAVE it.

Most of the cases in this series are based on daily life story. Although they may not be absolutely practical, once we are getting confident of the concept demonstrated, we are able to apply them in the real-world project.
