In this semester, I have a course about `Django Web Development`. The development tasks of this course are mainly based on `SQLite` and didn't put too much emphasis on `cloud-based` or `production-level` database configuration and deployment. By this chance, I try to combine the knowledge of the `IS-590 DBA class` and Django together -- build a `Google Cloud SQL(Postgres)` instance and deploy my Django app to `Google Cloud App Engine`; then connect them together.

# DEMO
- [URL: https://someone-blog.appspot.com](https://someone-blog.appspot.com)
- [Github: https://github.com/thitta/Someone.tw-Blog](https://github.com/thitta/Someone.tw-Blog)
- Test account: (......)
- Test password: (......)

# Part-1: Prepare for Deployment

- Prepare Django `ORM` and all other components of the application.
- Build Django `migrations` code for both ORM and mock data importing -- the later one is not mandatory but personally strongly recommended.
- Building `tests` before deployment is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

# Part-2: Create a Postgres on Google Cloud(GC)

## Create a GC Postgre

- Register for GC.
- Create a `project`.
- Under the project, create a new `resource` (select Postgres Database).
- Configure `specs` for the resource, mainly about CPU, RAM, Disc Type, and Disc Space.
- Wait a few minutes while Google is setting it ready!

## Set GC Postgres

- Set our local IP to the `whitelist` of GC Database in Google Cloud Platform(GCP) tool.
- Create a database `schema` on GC Platform.
- Create a database `user` on GC Platform.

## DBMS: pgAdmin

- Download and install DBMS `pgAdmin`
- Connect with the user and password we just set.

## Connect Django Development Environment to GC Postgres
- Install Python drivers for Postgres
```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```
- Create config block in the Django's `setting.py` file
``` python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'someone_blog', # this is the schema name
        'USER': 'someone_blog_client_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '35.188.117.159',
        'PORT': '5432',
    },
    'development': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        'TIME_ZONE': 'America/Chicago',
    }
}
```
- Theoratically, we are now ready for connecing and constructing our production database! 

Let Django do it for us.
```
python manage.py makemigrations cms
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py migrate cms
```

## Full-Text Search

- Build Full-text Index in Postgre
 
  - Although Postgres allows full-text search without full-text index, for the performance concern, if our application uses the feature regularly, building an index is still recommended.
 
  - It seems that we can't add full-text index by Django's ORM. We have to add it manually to the database via SQL.

```
CREATE INDEX site_post_search ON cms_post 
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', "Title" || ' ' || "Subtitle" || ' ' || "BodyMarkdown"))
```

 - ORM Code

```python
class Post(models.Model):
    # basic columns
    PostId = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, max_length=256)
    Title = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    Subtitle = models.CharField(max_length=256)
    # ......
    @classmethod
    def get_searched_posts(cls, text):
        vector = SearchVector('Title', 'Subtitle', 'BodyMarkdown')
        query = SearchQuery(text)
        posts = cls.objects.annotate(rank=SearchRank(vector, query)). \
            filter(IsPublic=True, rank__gte=0.02).order_by('-rank')
        return posts
```

## Other Necessary Configurations
- Remove none necessary permissions of the user via DBMS

```SQL
ALTER ROLE someone_blog_client_user NOCREATEROLE;
```

- Set Postgres to accepting `secured requests` only.

# Part-3: Deploy Django to GC App Engine and Connect to GC Postgres

Deploy Django to GC `App Engine(AE)` is a bit more complex. In essence, we can basically regard it as a highly compact and simplified cloud virtual machine that is meant to run our applications. When doing deployment, we have to build few special configuration files in AE's designated format and upload our application via GC's command-line tool -- `gcloud`.

## Create a Project in GC Platform

Since we have already built our project when constructing Postgres, this step can be skipped.

## Install GC SDK

Download Google Cloud SDK and execute the install shell script
```
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```

## Initiate GC SDK and Get Connected

Do
```
gcloud init
```

and follow its instructions to connect to our GC account and project.

## Add `main.py` file under the application root

This file provides a `WSGI` object to AE, 

```
from someone_blog.wsgi import application

# App Engine by default looks for a main.py file at the root of the app
# directory with a WSGI-compatible object called app.
# This file imports the WSGI-compatible object of your Django app,
# application from mysite/wsgi.py and renames it app so it is discoverable by
# App Engine without additional configuration.
# Alternatively, you can add a custom entrypoint field in your app.yaml:
# entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT mysite.wsgi
app = application
```

## Add a `app.yaml` file under the application root

This file specifies required configurations to AE, 

```
# [START django_app]
runtime: python37

handlers:
# This configures Google App Engine to serve the files in the app's static
# directory.
- url: /static
  static_dir: static/

# This handler routes all requests not caught above to your main app. It is
# required when static routes are defined, but can be omitted (along with
# the entire handlers section) when there are no static files defined.
- url: /.*
  script: auto
# [END django_app]
```

## Create `requires.txt` files under the application root.

This file specifies all the dependencies we used in our application. It's a standard python convention. 

```
DateTime==4.3
Django==2.2
Markdown==3.1
metapost==1.0.3
psycopg2-binary==2.8.2
pytz==2018.9
sqlparse==0.3.0
typing==3.6.6
tzlocal==1.5.1
zope.interface==4.6.0
```

## Configure database connection in `setting.py` of Django

```
if os.getenv('GAE_APPLICATION', None):
    # Running on production App Engine, so connect to Google Cloud SQL using
    # the unix socket at /cloudsql/<your-cloudsql-connection string>
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'someone_blog',
            'USER': 'someone_blog_client_user',
            'PASSWORD': '******',
            'HOST': '/cloudsql/someone-blog:us-central1:someone-blog-postgre',
            'PORT': '5432',
        },
    }
else:
    # Running locally so connect to either a local MySQL instance or connect to
    # Cloud SQL via the proxy. To start the proxy via command line:
    #
    #     $ cloud_sql_proxy -instances=[INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME]=tcp:3306
    #
    # See https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql-connect-proxy
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'someone_blog',
            'USER': 'someone_blog_client_user',
            'PASSWORD': '******',
            'HOST': '35.188.117.159',
            'PORT': '5432',
        },
    }
```

## Collect static files of our applications for hosting

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

## Deploy

Just one line. 

```
gcloud app deploy
```

Google will host our app under its `appspot.com` domain. If we want to connect our own domain to it, we have to configure some `HTTPS certification` and `DNS` things via GC Platform, but just let's call it a...semester.

# Does Google Cloud SQL and App Engine Make Life Easier?

- Definitely `YES`!
- Though deploying is still an excruciating process.
- At least we no longer have to worry about `SSH`, `Fire Wall`, `WSGI and Socket`, `Server Log`, `Apache/Nginx Service` and `Database Connections` -- service providers now take care of all these stuff very well and provides web interfaces for users to manipulate the settings when necessary.
- We can update our project just by entering `gcloud deploy`, instead of doing it via `SFTP` or `Github`.
- Coding Web is far more fun.

# What else We can do with Google Cloud Database

- Create a database to store web-scrapper dataset and share with our research team.
- Support application development.

PS. This project costs me about ($20/month)

# Database Recovery

I have to admit that I spend too much time on deploying the application and thus don't study Postgre's recovery too much. Fortunately, GC platform provides us an `automatically daily backup` option and recovery interface, which seems to work well.

# Database Scaling

Again, I don't have much time to study the scaling issues. However, it seems that we can easily scale our database with our `credit card` on GC platform.

(By the way, hosting a personal blog on Google Cloud SQL is a super `OVERKILL` -- the minimum database space size is `10GB`. `SQLite` should be decent enough for such purpose.)
